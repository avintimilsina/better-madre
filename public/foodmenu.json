			"description": "This is an all-in-one dish, where the deboned chicken encases a stuffing of rice and chestnuts. It will slice very easily and the sweetness of the chestnuts is set off with a simple parsley vinaigrette. Deboning a chicken is a fiddly job, so unless you are very confident, it is best to ask your butcher to do it for you. If you’re feeling brave",
